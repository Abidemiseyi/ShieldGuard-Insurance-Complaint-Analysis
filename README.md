4. Total Complaint By Commission Scheme: This visual elaborates the total complaints by the company commission scheme. A Commission scheme is a plan outlining how commissions are calculated and paid based on performance or sales. The reasons for complaints due to the commission scheme are: 
*	Overpromising: Sales staff might exaggerate product features to meet targets, resulting in unmet expectations and complaints.
*	Pressure Tactics: Aggressive selling to earn commissions may frustrate customers.
Therefore,the highest commission scheme causing the most complaints was Comm-2, with a total of 3.2k complaints, while the lowest was Comm-9, with only 1.0k complaints.
